# Setting up Postgres backup (optional)

The playbook can install and configure [docker-postgres-backup-local](https://github.com/prodrigestivill/docker-postgres-backup-local) for you via the [ansible-role-postgres-backup](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres-backup) Ansible role.

For details about configuring and installing it, you can check them via:
- [the role's document on the MASH (mother-of-all-self-hosting) project](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres-backup/blob/main/docs/configuring-postgres-backup.md)
- `roles/galaxy/postgres_backup/docs/configuring-postgres-backup.md` locally, if you have fetched the Ansible roles

**Note**: for a more complete backup solution (one that includes not only Postgres, but also other configuration/data files), you may wish to look into [BorgBackup](configuring-playbook-backup-borg.md) instead.
